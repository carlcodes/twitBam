I don't really know what I'm doing. This is me playing around with the twitter api and java and androids. First I created a way to tweet from my app, currently (12/27) I'm able to search something and display some tweets containing what I ssearched

a lot of this is taken from a tutorial. most of this code is not mine, but I have done some alterings and I understand how most of the code works.
