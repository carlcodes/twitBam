I don't really know what I'm doing. This is me playing around with the twitter api and java and androids. First I created a way to tweet from my app, currently (12/27) I'm able to search something and display some tweets containing what I ssearched

a lot of this is taken from a tutorial. most of this code is not mine, but I have done some alterings and I understand how most of the code works.

EDIT:

<h1>Wanna hear a story? I turned this into a twitter bot</h1>
<p>to win my roommate $650</p>
<p>My roommate is a turf major at MSU. He does a lot of work with how to manage golf courses and stuff, and he was a part of a competition with other universities taken place in florida.</p>
<p>One of the competitions was who has the most school spirit and can hashtag your university name and #GIS14_turfbowl. Easy, right?</p>
<p>My roommate found that Penn State started getting dirty and someone made a tiwtter bot. At first they were not going to stoop that low until they gave the GIS top execs a call to get the OK.</p>
<p>After MSU turf club got the okay to make a twitter bot, my roommate thought, "hey, my roommate is a developer he could probably do that". He asked me and I had messed with the twitter api a few weeks prior and said it'd probably be pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>I started out with tweeting multiple hashtags in a row, and right away I knew that was not the way because twitter wouldn't let you tweet duplicates. Hmmm how can I do this? Whats a way to tweet the same thing but trick twitter into thinking it's not? Well, I figured I could just grab random people's tweets. It worked!</p>
<p>For a while at least. I got a suspended account because I mentioned too many people in a certain amount of time. That was a pretty easy fix, I just had to check to see if there was an "@" symbol in it.</p>
<p>The competition was over and I destroyed Penn State's twitter bot by about 4,000 tweets. I have no idea why they didn't try to catch up. My roommate's club won $650 solely because of me</p>
<h3>The End.</h3>
